## Purpose:
Project File: "Implement and use a Stack structure to convert infix mathematical expressions to postfix, and then evaluate the postfix expressions. Input will be from a text file"  

main.py and stack.py are my own work. All other files were provided.

## Method:
- Create a stack class based on a singly linked structure
- Manipulate input strings via stack objects to convert infix to postfix
- Manipulate postfix strings via stack objects to evaluate the postfix expressions
- Output inputs, conversions and evaluations
- Pass all provided unit tests
